### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Agata, and I love frontend!

I became interested in web development a few years ago, and every new skill makes my passion for it grow. With a keen eye for detail, I bring design to life, ensuring that the final product is responsive and accessible. In my previous positions, I developed excellent organisation and communication skills. I thrive when faced with challenges and problems to solve - both independently and as a part of a team.
